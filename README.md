### MLB Pitch Tracking  

**Focus**

>By charting a major league pitch you can gain invaluable information both offensively _and_ defensively.  

Examples:

* _Offensive_ -  
  * Velocity difference over time
  * Off-speed efficiency
  * Pitch-type tendencies, favorites vs. weaknesses
 
* _Defensive_ -

  * Ground/Air ratio for hitters
  * Contact percentages based on counts and conditions
  * Fatigue indicated through loss of control or velocity
